        "*   The Azure Document Intelligence analysis successfully extracts detailed layout information including pages, paragraphs, lines, content, and bounding boxes with associated page numbers.\n",
        "*   A chunking strategy based on document paragraphs, using the layout information, was successfully implemented. This resulted in 122 layout chunks for the initial document.\n",
        "*   Each paragraph-based chunk was accurately associated with the page number(s) it spanned, leveraging the bounding box information (e.g., initial chunks on page 1).\n",
        "*   Summarization and relevance checking steps were successfully adapted to work with the new paragraph-based chunks, generating 122 summaries and identifying 37 relevant chunks for the initial document.\n",
        "*   The page number extraction logic was improved to accurately identify all unique page numbers spanned by the relevant layout chunks (e.g., pages 1 and 2 for the initial document).\n",
        "*   The final classification step was integrated to use the summaries of the layout-aware chunks and the improved page number information, resulting in classifications like \"Regulatory Matters\" for the 10-K, \"Accounting\" for the refinance document, and \"Accounting\" for the receipt.\n",
        "*   The layout-based chunking and page number extraction proved effective across different document types (10-K, refinance document, receipt) in accurately identifying and reporting the location of relevant content.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The use of Document Intelligence layout information significantly improves the granularity and accuracy of document chunking and the identification of relevant content locations compared to simple text-based methods.\n",
        "*   Further evaluation with a wider variety of complex document structures (e.g., documents with tables, figures, multi-column layouts) is recommended to fully assess the robustness of the layout-based approach.\n"
