The Classification Model Training explicitly uses distributed XGBoost within Databricks, leveraging multiple nodes in the cluster for scalable training.
Distributed XGBoost training in Databricks is performed using PySpark with parameters like num_workers to specify parallelism.
This enables efficient handling of large sharepoint data and faster model training times.

- Azure Blob Storage is the underlying object storage service.
- ADLS Gen2 extends Blob Storage with hierarchical namespace, fine-grained security, optimizing big data analytics.
- Azure Synapse Analytics provides a unified analytics platform combining big data (Spark Pools) and data warehousing (SQL Pools).
- Apache Spark running inside Synapse or Databricks uses Hadoop Azure filesystem connectors to read and write data from ADLS/Blob storage.
- Hadoop components (like YARN as resource manager in HDInsight) enable cluster resource management for Spark jobs.
