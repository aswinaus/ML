- Azure Blob Storage is the underlying object storage service.
- ADLS Gen2 extends Blob Storage with hierarchical namespace, fine-grained security, optimizing big data analytics.
- Azure Synapse Analytics provides a unified analytics platform combining big data (Spark Pools) and data warehousing (SQL Pools).
- Apache Spark running inside Synapse or Databricks uses Hadoop Azure filesystem connectors to read and write data from ADLS/Blob storage.
- Hadoop components (like YARN as resource manager in HDInsight) enable cluster resource management for Spark jobs.
